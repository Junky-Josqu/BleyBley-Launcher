# BleyBley-Launcher
work in progress!

Small Ruby launcher for Mount and and Blade Warband 
Version: ALPHA 0.5
Website :Josqu.de

Used Gems: https://github.com/fazibear/colorize

The finish of this little project is to create a small alternative Ruby Launcher for "Mount and Blade Warband"
because the native Linux-Launcher is extremly bugy on Linux.
